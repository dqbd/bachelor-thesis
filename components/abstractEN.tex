B-Tree is a data structure, which performs inserting, deleting, and searching of key-value pairs in $\mathcal{O}(\log{n})$ time. This thesis is about the implementation of a B-Tree capable of execution on GPU cards. Two variants of B-Tree are implemented: B$^+$Tree and B-Link-Tree, both modified to make use of the parallel processing power. These variants are studied and implemented for NVIDIA GPUs using the \CC\ programming language and CUDA API with the help of the TNL library. This thesis contains an analysis of existing GPU and CPU solutions and explains the changes and optimizations made to the presented solution. All variants are thoroughly tested, measured, and compared against chosen GPU and CPU implementations.
