\section{Prior Art}

Previous GPU projects mentioned in Awad et al. \cite{awad} focused on search throughput. Until recently, the general approach for updating is either to perform such updates on the CPU or to rebuild the structure from scratch.

Fix et al. \cite{fix2011accelerating} measured substantial performance speedup compared to sequential CPU execution by running independent queries in each thread block. Insertion and deletion are not optimized, as the tree rebuilds itself on the CPU and copies the memory contents back to the GPU.

Kaczmarski \cite{kaczmarski} utilized the relationship between a sorted list and demonstrated improved insertion time by presorting keys and proposing a novel bottom-up approach when constructing a tree. The work also explored several methods of searching within a tree node.

Awad et al. \cite{awad} proposed a GPU implementation of B-Tree that supports concurrent queries (single, range, successor), insertion, and deletion. To achieve state-of-art performance, B-Link-Tree has been coupled with proactive splitting and Warp Cooperative Work Sharing as proposed by Ashkiani et al. \cite{ashkiani2018dynamic}.
