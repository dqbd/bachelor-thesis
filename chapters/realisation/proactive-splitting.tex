\section{Proactive Splitting}

As specified in Algorithm \ref{alg:b-tree-insert} and Algorithm \ref{alg:b-tree-delete}, we first traverse to the node to perform the node update, and any potential balancing is performed in a bottom-up manner. In our implementation, we decided to opt-in to the top-down approach by splitting any full nodes directly when traversing.

With this approach, we are not required to preserve a stack of parent nodes, as we are guaranteeing every operation will update nodes in at most two depths. \todo{Add proof}. Nodes are split more often and prematurely as a trade-off.
