\section{Insertion}

During insertion, a single kernel is executed from the host. We follow the Work Cooperative Work-Sharing strategy; thus, a single thread (with assigned key-value pair) is chosen from a queue using \code{cg::tiled\_partition<32>.ballot()}, and all threads in a warp cooperate to complete the insertion together.
