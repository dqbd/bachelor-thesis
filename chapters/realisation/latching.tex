\section{Latching and Concurrency Control}

For our implementation of B-Trees, an additional attribute $x.writelock$ is used to prevent multiple threads from writing to the same node at the same time.

In our B$^+$Tree implementation of insertion, traversal is prevented if encountering a node with a write lock to ensure data serializability. B-Link-Tree has this limitation lifted, as we're able to traverse even in the split subtree mid-split.
