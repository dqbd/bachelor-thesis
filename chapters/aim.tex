\subsection{Aim of the Thesis}

The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to familiarize with GPU programming using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), analyze the Template Numerical Library (TNL), and introduce a correct implementation of the B-Tree data structure supporting native querying, insertion, and deletion.

Performance uplift is measured against implementations found in standard \CC\ Standard Library (STL) and other comparable CPU data structures. Our work is also evaluated with state-of-the-art GPU implementations of B-Tree.
