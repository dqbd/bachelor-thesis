\section{Aim of the Thesis}

The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to familiarize with GPU programming using CUDA, study and analyze the Template Numerical Library and introduce a correct implementation of the B-Tree data structure, increasing its performance by exploiting the parallel nature of a GPU.

Performance is measured against implementations found in standard C++ STL library and other state-of-the-art CPU data structures. Speedwell as similar GPU implementations of B-Tree and other data structures, such as hash table.
