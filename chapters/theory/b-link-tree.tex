\section{B-Link-Tree}



Previous approaches include locking a subtree of highest affected node \cite{samadi1976b}, which, albeit straightforward, severely reduced concurrency.

In order to alleviate the bottleneck without risking inconsistency, \textit{B-Link-Tree} relaxes the definition of B$^+$Trees. As explained by Graefe \cite{goetz-tech}:

\begin{definition}
  B-Link-Tree is a B$^+$Tree with following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Each node $x$ has additional attributes:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $x.sibling$, a pointer to a right sibling node at the same depth,
            \item $x.highkey$, the maximum value found in the subtree rooted by $x$ (every key found in $x$ is less then $x.highkey$).
          \end{itemize}
    \item Does not require locks nor latches for reading.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Splitting during node insertion is divided into two independent steps: splitting the node and inserting a new separator key to the parent node.
