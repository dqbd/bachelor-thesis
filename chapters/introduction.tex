- GPGPU zrychluje instrukce
- Index struktury na GPU -> proč? Rychlý přístup, vkládání, mazání
- Faster than Thrust
- Insertion is slow

- GPUs are different than CPUs. Instead of reducing the latency and increasing speed of executing instructions, GPUs are achieving better performance by increasing throughput of instructions. Multiple execution streams achieve are able to process much more data with proper techniques utilizing parallel computations at the cost of efficiency on sequential operations.

- GPUs are now really powerful. Much more than GPUs. We can utilize their parallel nature to reduce the latencies found in CPUs. Most of the common usages of GPUs are related towards vector and matrix based operations. With the increasing memory sizes found in GPUs it opens a possibility of storing large quantity of data in GPUs directly. Having strong and general data structures open up potential savings which might be useful in database systems.
