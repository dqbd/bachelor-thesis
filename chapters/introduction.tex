With the advent of programmable shaders and support for floating-point operations, General-purpose computing on Graphical Processing Units (GPU) became suitable for scientific computing. Since then, GPUs have gained significant adoption for various computational tasks, such as deep learning, and became an essential staple for enabling high-performance computing for the masses.

Nevertheless, the toolbox for general purpose data structures is lacking. One such data structure commonly used in classical CPU systems is B-Tree. Widely used in database systems and file systems, they became the default data structure used for reading and writing a large amount of arbitrary data of an unknown domain. Optimizing such data structure for GPU would allow us to utilize the parallel nature of GPU to accelerate searching and insertion in comparison to search and insertion on CPUs.
